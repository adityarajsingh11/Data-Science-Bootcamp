Article 2 of the Indian Constitution grants the Parliament the power to admit into the Union, or establish, new states. 

This means Parliament can bring new states into the existing Indian Union, or create entirely new states within the country. 

The article also specifies that these actions can be taken "on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit," implying Parliament has broad discretion in setting the rules for new states.
